🎉 MCP AGENT SETUP COMPLETE!
=============================

✅ Your LLM can now EXECUTE commands, not just suggest them!

📍 Location: /home/peter/projects/ollama-mcp-agent/

🆕 WHAT'S NEW:

1. ✅ MCP Server installed
2. ✅ AI Agent with command execution
3. ✅ Smart approval system (auto-approves safe operations)
4. ✅ Conversation memory (remembers last 3 exchanges for follow-up questions)
5. ✅ Enhanced Kubernetes tools (health checks, logs, describe, namespaces)
6. ✅ System-aware (knows your PC specs, k8s context, etc.)

🔒 APPROVAL BEHAVIOR:

✅ AUTO-APPROVED (executes immediately):
   - Reading files
   - Checking system status (disk, memory, CPU, network)
   - Kubernetes queries (get pods, namespaces, logs)
   - Network info (show interfaces)
   - Safe execute commands

⚠️ REQUIRES CONFIRMATION:
   - Writing/creating files
   - Deleting files or directories (rm, rmdir, unlink)
   - Dangerous operations (dd, mkfs, fdisk, parted)

💭 CONVERSATION MEMORY:
   Agent remembers previous outputs! You can ask follow-up questions:
   You: "check my cluster for issues"
   Agent: [shows pod in Error state]
   You: "show logs for that pod"
   Agent: [knows which pod you mean!]
   You: "what's causing this error?"
   Agent: [analyzes the logs and suggests fix]

🚀 HOW TO USE:

Basic (one-off command):
------------------------
./agent "check disk space"
./agent "show network interfaces"
./agent "list docker containers"

Interactive Mode (RECOMMENDED):
--------------------------------
./agent -i

Then chat and ask it to do things:
  You: show me memory usage
  Agent: [generates 'free -h', asks approval]
  You: y
  Agent: [executes and shows results]

Network Configuration Example:
-------------------------------
./agent "show my network interfaces"
./agent "change my DNS to 8.8.8.8"
  ⚠️  It will ask for approval before making changes!

🔒 SAFETY FEATURES:

✅ Safe operations auto-approved (fast workflow)
✅ File writes/deletes require confirmation
✅ Shows EXACTLY what it will do before dangerous operations
✅ You can review before execution
✅ Type 'show' to see full details
✅ Type 'N' or just press Enter to cancel
✅ Conversation memory for context-aware commands

Example approval prompt:
------------------------
🤖 LLM wants to:
Check disk space

Tool: execute_command
Arguments:
  command: df -h

Allow this action? [y/N/show]: _

Options:
  y     - Yes, execute it
  N     - No, cancel (default)
  show  - Show full JSON details

⚡ QUICK START:

1. Try the demo:
   ./agent-demo

2. Test with safe command:
   ./agent "what's my hostname?"

3. Interactive mode:
   ./agent -i
   
4. Read full docs:
   cat MCP-AGENT-README.md

🎯 USE CASES:

✅ Network Management:
   ./agent "show my network settings"
   ./agent "configure DNS to use 1.1.1.1"

✅ System Monitoring:
   ./agent "check system memory"
   ./agent "show disk usage"
   ./agent "what processes are using most CPU?"

✅ Docker/Kubernetes:
   ./agent "list all containers"
   ./agent "check my k8s cluster for any issues"  # Cluster-wide health check!
   ./agent "show pods in prometheus namespace"
   ./agent "get logs from that error pod"  # Remembers which pod!
   ./agent "list all namespaces"
   ./agent "describe that pod"

✅ File Operations:
   ./agent "list files in /tmp"
   ./agent "create a backup of config.yaml"
   ./agent "find large log files"

✅ Development:
   ./agent "count Python files in ~/projects"
   ./agent "show git status for all repos"

📋 COMMAND OPTIONS:

./agent "request"              # One-off request
./agent -i                     # Interactive mode
./agent -y "request"           # Auto-approve (DANGEROUS!)
./agent -m qwen2.5-coder:7b    # Use smarter model

🆚 COMPARISON:

OLD WAY (ask):
--------------
./ask "how do I check disk space?"
→ LLM: "Use the df -h command"
→ You: [copy and run manually]

NEW WAY (agent):
----------------
./agent "check disk space"
→ LLM: [generates df -h]
→ Agent: "Allow? [y/N]"
→ You: y
→ Agent: [executes and shows results]

🔗 INSTALL ALIASES (OPTIONAL):

./install-aliases.sh
source ~/.bashrc

Then use anywhere:
  agent "your request"
  agent -i

📚 FILES CREATED:

├── agent                    # Main agent script
├── agent-demo               # Demo/tutorial

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. The agent uses qwen2.5-coder:3b by default (balanced)
2. For complex tasks, use -m qwen2.5-coder:7b
3. NEVER use -y with untrusted commands
4. Some commands need sudo (agent will tell you)
5. Network changes require root privileges

🎓 LEARNING PATH:

1. Start with read-only commands (auto-approved):
   ./agent "show system info"
   ./agent "check disk space"
   ./agent "list kubernetes namespaces"

2. Try follow-up questions (uses conversation memory):
   ./agent -i
   > check my cluster for issues
   > show logs for that pod
   > what's causing this?

3. File operations (requires approval):
   ./agent "create test file in /tmp"
   ./agent "read /etc/hostname"

4. Kubernetes troubleshooting:
   ./agent "find any pods with issues"  # Cluster-wide scan
   ./agent "describe that error pod"
   ./agent "help me fix this"

💡 PRO TIPS:

- Use interactive mode for multi-step tasks
- Be specific in your requests
- Review commands before approving
- Start with simple, safe commands
- Keep network changes for last

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:

Q: Agent not responding?
A: Check ollama status: systemctl status ollama

Q: Command failed?
A: Some need sudo, agent will indicate this

Q: Wrong command generated?
A: Be more specific or use smarter model

Q: Want to cancel?
A: Just press Enter or type 'N'

🎉 YOU'RE READY!

Try it now:
./agent -i

Then ask:
"show me memory usage"

Enjoy your AI assistant with real system access! 🚀

For network config: ./agent "show my network interfaces"
Then: ./agent "what can you help me configure?"
